Project is divided into two parts Project containg web pages and SpringHibernateExample containg controllers and data manipulation part
Steps to run
Set up database mysql by adding a new databse test
update dtabase username nad password if neccesary

Run SpringHibernateexample on server tomcat 8.5(set tomcat port to its default value 8080)
(Eclipse is preffered for running SpringHibernateExample)

Run project on another server (IIS for minimum problems) with project  application name set  to 'pro' and port number 7999
run project directly by iis or by typing "http://localhost:7999/pro/#!" in web browser
Also if there is any prob running download Allow-Control-Allow-Origin extension and while running the url click on extension and enable cross-origin resource sharing
If problem remains try toggling enable cross-origin resource sharing.
